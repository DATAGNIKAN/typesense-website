# Help

If you run into any issues or have general questions, here are a couple of ways to ask for help:

- Use GitHub's native search to search through past conversations in our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Atypesense++issues&type=issues).
- Browse and search through [past conversations](https://threads.typesense.org/) in our Slack community. 
- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/typesense/typesense/issues) with any questions or bug reports.
- Join our public [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/typesense-community/shared_invite/zt-2fetvh0pw-ft5y2YQlq4l_bPhhqpjXig) to discuss general questions and/or issues.
- Schedule a call with a member of the core Typesense team, by [sponsoring Typesense on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/typesense?frequency=one-time) and picking the appropriate one-time sponsorship tier, and email us at contact at typesense dot org
